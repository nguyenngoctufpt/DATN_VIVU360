# AGENTS.md - AI Maintenance Guide

This document is for AI coding assistants working on Vietnam Travel Planner.

## Project Overview

- Public visitors browse plans, maps, calendars, and cost summaries.
- Admin login unlocks edit mode in the public calendar viewer. Plan editing
  lives in the shared viewer plus CLI/MCP, not in a separate admin dashboard.
- Express + SQLite backend serves the API and static builds in production.
- Docker image is published to GHCR on push to `main`.

**SQLite is the source of truth per environment.** Frontend fetches data from
`/api/plans`. There is no static JSON fallback and deploy must not copy data
between environments.

## File Ownership

| Purpose | Files |
|---|---|
| Public frontend | `public/index.html` |
| Admin login gate | `admin/src/` |
| Backend API | `api/src/` |
| Schema migration | `api/src/db/schema.sql`, `api/src/db/migrate.ts` |
| Public Vite config | `public/vite.config.ts` |

Do not edit deprecated root `index.html`, root `vite.config.ts`, or
`dev-server.ts` for production behavior.

## Data Boundary

- Prod data lives in prod SQLite (`/data/travel.db` in Docker).
- Dev data lives in local SQLite (`DB_PATH` or local default).
- Update data through Admin/CLI/MCP against the target environment.
- Do not put trip data into migrations, deploy scripts, or source files to move
  it from dev to prod.
- `runMigration()` only performs idempotent schema upgrades.

## AI Tooling

External AI systems should use the MCP/CLI flow documented in
`docs/ai-integration.md`. The same editing surface is available for admin plans
and user session plans:

- Without an admin password, writes create or update a session plan and return a
  share URL with `?session=...`.
- With an admin password, writes can update admin/sample plans directly.
- Vexere fare search is exposed through app-owned server credentials; never
  expose Vexere credentials to clients or prompts.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Backend | Node.js 20, Express, better-sqlite3, jose |
| Public frontend | Alpine.js 3, Tailwind CDN, Leaflet |
| Admin login gate | React 18, Tailwind |
| Database | SQLite |
| Build | Vite + tsc |

## Dev Workflow

```bash
# Terminal 1
cd api && npm run dev

# Terminal 2
cd admin && npm run dev

# Terminal 3
cd public && npm run dev
```

Public: http://localhost:3000
Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin

## Deploy

```bash
cd ~/vietnam-travel
./scripts/redeploy.sh
```

Deploy keeps the existing DB. To change plan data, use Admin/CLI/MCP for the
target environment. To replace a whole environment DB, do an explicit SQLite
backup/restore outside the deploy path.

## Cost Model

Costs belong on activities (`sub_locations`):

- `activityType`: `sightseeing`, `accommodation`, `food`, `cafe`, `transport`, `other`
- `pricingMode`: `per_person`, `per_room`, `per_group`
- `unitPrice`, `quantity`, `surcharge`, `adultPrice`, `childPrice`
- `actualCost`: real paid/spent cost for the activity, stored separately from
  estimated cost fields and not used in current budget estimate totals

Use `food` for new eating/drinking stops. Legacy `cafe` activities are still
accepted by the API but are displayed and totaled together with `food`.

Location-level description, highlight, activities, food, and cost columns are
legacy storage only and should not be used for new UI, MCP, CLI, or admin
workflows. Overview UI should summarize `sub_locations`.

## Known Gotchas

- `api/travel.db` / root `travel.db` may be local artifacts; prod DB is
  `/data/travel.db` in Docker.
- Calendar and cost UI should treat activities as the source of truth.
- Public route paths `/map`, `/calendar`, and `/month` should remain stable.
